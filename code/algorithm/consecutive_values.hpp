    ::has_consecutive_value
        Intention/Description
           Searches a container for the first sequence of count identical items, each equal to `value`.

        Prerequisite

        Parameters
			c		- the container of elements to examine
			count	- the length of the sequence to search for
			value	- the value of the elements to search for

            Type requirements
				- The container must support forward iterators

        Return value
			Boolean value that returns `true` if the sequence is found, otherwise returns `false`

        Notes

        Complexity
			O(N)

        Exceptions
        
        Example
		```cpp
		#include <iostream>
		#include <algorithm>
		#include <iterator>
		
		int main()
		{
		   const char sequence[] = "1001010100010101001010101";
		
		   std::cout << std::boolalpha;
		   std::cout << "Has 4 consecutive zeros: "
		             << has_consecutive_values(sequence,4,'0') << '\n';
		   std::cout << "Has 3 consecutive zeros: "
		             << has_consecutive_values(sequence,3,'0') << '\n';
		}
		```
		Output
		```cpp
		Has 4 consecutive zeros: false
		Has 3 consecutive zeros: true
		```
