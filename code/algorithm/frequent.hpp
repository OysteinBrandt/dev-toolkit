    ::most_frequent
        Intention/Description
            Find element that appears most frequently in the range [first, last)

        Prerequisite
            A sorted collection

        Parameters
            first -
            last -

            Type requirements

        Return value
            X_Iterator to found element

        Notes

        Complexity
            Linear?

        Exceptions
        
        Example
            #include <vector>
            #include <iostream>
            #include <algorithm>

            std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3};
            std::sort(begin(numbers), end(numbers));

            auto r = most_frequent(numbers);
            std::cout << "the most frequent number is " << *r << "\n";

    TODO:
        - Add parameter for using a predicate to compare elements
        - Check edge cases, (e.g. if empty, all occur once)
        - Indicate type of iterator in template (ForwardIt, InputIt, etc.)
        - Support const iterators
        - Support const collection
        
    ALTERNATIVE NAMES:
        - repeated ++
        - recurring +
        - common
        - repetitive --
