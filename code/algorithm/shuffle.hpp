    ::shuffle
        Intention/Description
			Reorders the elements in the container such that each possible permutation of those elements has equal probability of appearance

        Prerequisite

        Parameters
			c - the container of elements to shuffle randomly

            Type requirements
				The container must support iterators that meet the requirements of `ValueSwappable` and `LegacyRandomAccessIterator`

        Return value
			None

        Notes

        Complexity
			O(N)

        Exceptions
        
        Example
